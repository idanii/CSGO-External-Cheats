## **Download**
You can download the exe version of this cheat by clicking [here](https://github.com/idanii/CSGO-External-Cheats/releases/tag/TriggeredLauncher), but if you ask me don't do that because you won't be able to change the offsets in case they got outdated, my best suggestion is to download the whole project and run it manually through Visual Studio.

## **Modules**
* Triggerbot
* GlowESP
* Bunnyhop
* Aimbot
* ESP


## **Currently In Build Modules**
* MarkESP (basically a wallhack for your teammates who don't use cheats)

## **Usage**
This cheat is pretty easy to use.
You can't change the keybinds for different modules, they are all already set.
By pressing different keybinds you can toggle on/off different modules and enjoy the cheat.

## **Q&A**
*For what reasons have you built this for?*
> The only reason I've created this project is for educational purposes.
> I've wanted to know if I'm able to do such thing.

*Do you plan on creating other projects like this in the future?*
> Of course. Game hacking is a subject I've always had interest in.

*Can I get banned for using this cheat?*
> I haven't tried to bypass valve's anti-cheat but as far as I saw I didn't get banned after one week of using it blatantly, in this way or another you are always vulnerable to get banned manually by a person.
