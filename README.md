## **Download**
You can download the EXE version of this cheat by clicking [here](https://github.com/idanii/Triggered/releases), but I wouldn't recommend doing that because you won't be able to change the offsets in case they get outdated in the future (and they will). My recommendation is to download the whole project and run it using Visual Studio.

## **Modules**
* Triggerbot
* GlowESP
* Bunnyhop
* Aimbot
* BoxESP


## **Currently In Development Modules**
* MarkESP (A "wallhack" for your teammates who may not use cheats)

## **Usage**
This cheat is very easy to use.
You can't change the keybinds for different modules, they are all already hard-coded.
You can toggle on and off different modules only by pressing the keybinds.

## **Common Asked Questions**
### *The box ESP isn't working properly, why does it happen and how do I fix that?*
This might happen because one: you didn't update the offsets, or two: you're running CS:GO in fullscreen mode.
Please make sure the offsets you use are up to date and you run CS:GO in windowed mode.

### *For what reasons have you built this for?*
The one and only reason I've created and built this project is for educational purposes.

### *Do you plan on creating other projects like this in the future?*
Of course. Game hacking is a subject I've always had an interest in.

### *Can I get banned for using this cheat?*
I haven't tried to bypass valve's anti-cheat but as far as I saw I didn't get banned after 40 hours of using it blatantly. In this way or another you are always vulnerable to get banned by staff, so keep that in mind.
