## **Download**
You can download the exe version of this cheat by clicking [here](https://github.com/idanii/Triggered/releases), but if you ask me don't do that because you won't be able to change the offsets in case they got outdated. My suggestion is to download the whole project and run it as debug mode through Visual Studio.

## **Modules**
* Triggerbot
* GlowESP
* Bunnyhop
* Aimbot
* ESP


## **Currently In Build Modules**
* MarkESP (basically a wallhack for your teammates who don't use cheats)

## **Usage**
This cheat is pretty easy to use.
You can't change the keybinds for different modules, they are all already have been set.
By pressing different keybinds you can toggle on/off different modules and enjoy the cheat.

## **Common Asked Questions**
### *The box ESP isn't working properly, why does it happen and how do I fix that?*
This may happen because you didn't update the offsets or because you're running CS:GO as fullscreen.
Please make sure the offsets you use are updated and you run CS:GO on windowed mode.

### *For what reasons have you built this for?*
The only reason I've created this project is for educational purposes.

### *Do you plan on creating other projects like this in the future?*
Of course. Game hacking is a subject I've always had interest in.

### *Can I get banned for using this cheat?*
I haven't tried to bypass valve's anti-cheat but as far as I saw I didn't get banned after 40 hours of using it blatantly, in this way or another you are always vulnerable to get banned manually by a person.
