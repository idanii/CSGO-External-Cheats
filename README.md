## **Modules**
* Triggerbot
* GlowESP
* Bunnyhop

## **Usage**
This hack is pretty easy to use.
All you gotta do is download the project, make sure you open the game and then launch the program. **(Although you may need to update the offsets since they can get outdated after some time. You can get up-to-date offsets by using [Hazedumper](https://github.com/frk1/hazedumper/blob/master/csgo.cs)**.

## **Q&A**
*Why have you built this for?*
> The only reason I've created this project is for educational purposes.
> I've wanted to know if I'm able to do such thing.

*Do you plan on creating another projects like this in the future?*
> Of course. Game hacking is a subject I've always had interest in.

*⚠️ **I've been working on this project for like 4 days so I don't really know if there are any problems with it. (I haven't tried to bypass valve's anti-cheat but as far as I saw I didn't get banned after one week of using it blatantly)***
