## **Download**
You can download the exe version of this cheat by clicking [here](https://github.com/idanii/CSGO-External-Cheats/releases/tag/TriggeredLauncher), but if you ask me don't do that because you won't be able to change the offsets in case they got outdated, my best suggestion is to download the whole project and run it manually through Visual Studio.

## **Modules**
* Triggerbot
* GlowESP
* Bunnyhop

## **Currently In Build Modules**
* Aimbot
* MarkESP (basically wallhack for your teammates who don't use cheats)

## **Usage**
This hack is pretty easy to use.
All you gotta do is download the project, make sure you open the game and then launch the program. **(Although you may need to update the offsets since they can get outdated after some time. You can get up-to-date offsets by using [Hazedumper](https://github.com/frk1/hazedumper/blob/master/csgo.cs)**.

## **Q&A**
*For what reasons have you built this for?*
> The only reason I've created this project is for educational purposes.
> I've wanted to know if I'm able to do such thing.

*Do you plan on creating other projects like this in the future?*
> Of course. Game hacking is a subject I've always had interest in.

*Can I get banned for using this cheat?*
> I haven't tried to bypass valve's anti-cheat but as far as I saw I didn't get banned after one week of using it blatantly, in this way or another you are always vulnerable to get banned manually by a person.
